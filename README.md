# Trickle

A Flutter client app for Spotify. 

## Scope

Limited to a single feature: creating flows for songs to "trickle into" playlists (e.g. Discovery -> Cool New Songs -> Favorites). Currently wondering if and how much I should expand its feature set. Make it a somewhat full player with a bunch of "tools" like the aforementioned, or keep it simple?
